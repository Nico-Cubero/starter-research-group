Welcome to the Computer Vision and Robotics Lab, part of the [Department of Computer Architecture and Technology](https://www.google.com) at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es). The Computer Vision and Robotics Lab focuses on the resarch on active vision, autonomous navigation, neuromorphic vision, control, perception - action loops, collaboration and robotics. We are not interested on passive vision sensors but rather on sensors that can actively change their point of view or perspective, the way they perceive their environment by adaptation or select the most important information driven by the task assuming that allows for smart decision making. To enable active vision, our research is also focused on architectures that achieve real-time performance.

We have long expertise on low-level image processing: we have done optical flow algorithms (energy based, gradient based, block matching, etc) and similar approaches for stereo models; we have also models for foreground/background substraction (in surveillance applications) and local contrast descriptors (pixel wise orientation, energy, intrinsic dimensionality, etc). We are also interested in multi-perspective vision, autonomous navigation, or structure from motion, specially any processing from motion that can be achieved in real-time. We have worked in different fields bus specially on ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems for cars), autonomous navigation with UAVs, video-surveillance applications, robotics.
