title: FPGA implementation of optical flow, disparity, and low-level features
summary: Fine-grain pipelined and superscalar datapath to reach high performance at low working clock frequencies with FPGAs. The final goal is to achieve a data-throughput of one data per clock cycle. We show implementations of optical flow, disparity, and low-level local features
