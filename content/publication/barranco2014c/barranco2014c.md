abstract: Current motion estimation methods use very sophisticated techniques that require high computational complexity, with low time performance, and large resources. The current framework is considered exhausted. DVSs  (Dynamic Visual Sensors) efficiently encode and transmit motion signals. They are valuable to study the early visual motion providing motion boundaries that are salient.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
