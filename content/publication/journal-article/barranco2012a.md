abstract = "We present a model and a hardware architecture for the computation of bottom-up inherent
visual attention for FPGA. The bottom-up inherent attention is generated including local
energy, local orientation maps, and red-green and blue-yellow color opponencies. In this
work, we describe the simplifications to parallelize and embed the model without significant
accuracy loss. We also include feedback loops to adapt the weights of the features,
depending on the target application."
